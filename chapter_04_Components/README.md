## Config Driven UI
  Changing the UI parts based on the Data for a perticular senario It's called Config Driven UI.
  Ex: In a Food delivery App promotions and offers varies for diffrent cities and location. We do not have to create seperate App to show the the different Banners for the promotion. Insted we can Just Create a component which will be showing different promotions of Banner based on the location which come from the API data. So the data for the banner component will be different based on the location and will be shown in same the Application. This process called Config driven UI.

  ## key
  - Key is an unique identifier. key helps React to keep track of the react elements

  ## index as a key's value
  - Passing indes as a key's value is not recommended if the data doesn't have the id then you can at least use it in those scenarios.
